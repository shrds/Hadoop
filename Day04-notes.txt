------

What is Hadoop? [Both]
	> Storage
	> Processing

What is name of the processsing layer in Hadoop 1?
	> MapReduce

What is name of the processsing layer in Hadoop 2?
	> YARN

Which processes are there in HDFS?
	> NameNode > does > Store MetaData > Master
	> DataNode > does > Store Data > Slave

Which processes will be there when you look at a Slave machine?
	> DataNode and NodeManager

What is the cute name given to a computational resource in YARN?
	> Container

Who will take care of containers in a [particular]machine?
	> NodeManager

HDFS: FILE => BLOCKS => DataNodes => NameNode
YARN: Computer => CONTAINERS => NodeManagers => ResourceManager

Which mechanism helps hadoop to be FAULT TOLARENT? [DATA]node failures
	> Replication

Which mechanism helps hadoop to skip SPOF? Single Point of Failure?
	> High Availability > with the help of StandBy NameNode

Hadoop Federation is __________ of NameNode?
	> Horizontal Scaling or Scale Out feature

Installation Files:

$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce -> examples jar

HDFS:
-----

$ hdfs dfs -ls /
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /

prefix => 'hdfs dfs'

Execution:
----------

$ hadoop jar <jar-file> <prog-name> <input-path> <output-path> 
$ hadoop jar /locate/it/<jar-file> <prog-name> <input-path> <output-path> 

prefix => 'hadoop jar'

wordcount => how many time a particular word occured

hadoop-streaming.jar => any other language program

HDFS => imp

input => HDFS => we bring input here => data ingestion
	diff ways:
		1. rdbms => sqoop => help to put in hdfs
		2. webservers/remote location => flume => help to put that in hdfs
		3. file/folders => put command   

output => HDFS => outcome of an operation => process => analysis
		diff ways:
		1. write a MR prog => lot of coding
		2. use HIVE => a tool => helps you to query hadoop with sql
		3. use PIG => a tool => helps you to write some analysis commands/help to perform ETL

copy a file from cluster to cluster => distcp
