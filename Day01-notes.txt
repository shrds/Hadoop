Please ask the questions in one post.

BigData and Hadoop, What is it that we are going to learn among them? HADOOP

BigData -> we need to understand, as what is it
Hadoop -> Learn to apply -> course is on this

When there are plenty of resources available online/internet? why are you here?
	> view point
	> Interactive, Structured or guided, Short Time for Quick Understanding
	> many versions, many docs, many components

What is the realtionship between BigData and Hadoop?
	> BigData -> Domain -> Problem Statement
	> Hadoop -> Technology -> one of the Solution

SQL, ETL, JAVA, xyz -> some tech, so learning
DATA -> we do operations on data

BigData -> what is it?

English -> Large Data -> Huge Data -> Big Data -> Synonyms

Quantifiyable way: IBMs 4V model

Volume -> Size
	- size does matter; >= 10 TB
	- How it impacts? 10 TB file
	- 2 TB is the one, get a HDD, use it
	- HDD is not 10 TB
	what is your computer hard disk capacity? 

Velocity -> Speed
	- rate of data inflow
	- External HDD, it will take year occupy it fully
	- what happens? out of blue, you came to know that HDD is full in 2 days?
	- How it impacts? when load is coming suddenly? how to handle.
	- scalable solution
	- example, cooking solution at home vs 40 people

Variety -> Specialty
	- Different Types of data
	- 2 Types
		1. Data inside Tables (Structured Data) [data + metadata(schema)]
		2. Data outside Tables (Unstructured Data) [only data, no meta] we are clue less about the data

		How many times I used the word 'DATA' in this running notes? may be difficult
		Columns -> messages, how many messages are having the word 'DATA'? 
			sql> select count(*) from stable where MESSAGES LIKE '%DATA%';

			Unstructure -> not only unreadable (notes, log, emails, sms)
					unreadable -> media, audio, video, image, binary, etc. -> (little % of organizations will use)

Veracity -> Strentgh
	- Trust Worthiness of Data, Genunity of Data
	- How it impacts? it challenging to rely on data at huge volumes.
	- ex: 5 students in a class, below are the marks
		[10, 20, 30, 90, 50] -> Highest Mark -> 90 -> looks normal
		[0, 90, 0, 0, 0] -> Highest Mark -> 90 -> not normal -> why only one guy got huge marks rest all failed? 
		[90, 90, 90, 90, 90] -> Highest Mark -> 90 -> not normal -> how come every be best?

		is the question asked same? YES
		is the answer received same? YES
		is the data used same? NO

		GiGo -> garbage in , garbage out

Data -> Villian -> Gangster
RDBMS -> Hero -> Cop

BigData -> Big Problem -> 4Vs -> Super Villian -> Joker, Aliens
Hadoop -> Super Hero -> BatMan, super Man

In the beginning, when people got the bigdata problem?
	they tried to invent a solution?
	Direction1: Let us build a Better Computer(OS)
		ex: hadoop, spark, etc,.
	Direction2: Let us build a Better DataBase
		ex: NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc

HardWare: both solution focus on cluster hardware

cluster -> a group machines working together -> scale out architecture -> scalable

Vertical Scaling -> upgrade -> limitation
Horizontal Scaling -> bring another machine -> 
1 TB machine
4 TB, needed, 4 machines -> n TB, n machines -> scalable

How Hadoop is going to work? better os.

1 + 2 = 3 ; simple calculation

1,2 -> if i remove them -> will i get result 3 ? NO
+ -> if i remove it -> will i get result 3? NO

1,2 -> Data -> Storage Management -> Cluster -> Distributed Storage -> HDFS
+ -> Operaion -> Process Management -> Cluster -> Distbuted Computing/processing -> YARN

Hadoop => HDFS + YARN

Hadoop -> platform
pig,hive,etc -> on top of hadoop

MS WINDOWS - os - platform
MS OFFICE - app - on top of it

HDFS -> Hadoop Distributed File System

Hadoop 2 -> This is the one we are learning

How do you commute to office? Reality show, Can you walk to office? 

	may be you can do it -> you have the ability
		you wont do it daily -> it is not convenient

hadoop -> is not a replacemet for existign tech -> it is a complement
hadoop -> can be used in any where except visualization

we are at slide 16 done.

HomeWork:
---------
By Thursday (Day 4)
Finish VM setup
Finish LINUX Commands
Finish JAVA ESSENTIALS Course
